## From my mom

- Users should be able to insert into and store in a general DB -- that's how you find new recipes and grow your "cookbook"!
- Ingredients section on the recipe page doesn't need a checkmark list -- that's redundant with the checkmarks for the recipe steps. BUT it should have a separate grocery page where you can see all ingredients you need for a "selected recipe list" (i.e., select chicken fajitas for Monday, chili dogs on Tuesday and see both show up on an ingredient list)
- Quick upload page is a good idea, because it can be a quick and dirty "send me this recipe" when you need it now
